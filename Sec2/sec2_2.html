    <h1>C if...else Statement</h1>
    <p><b>In this tutorial, you will learn to create for 
        loop in C programming with the help of examples.</b>
    <br>
    In programming, a loop is used to repeat a block of 
    code until the specified condition is met.</p>
    
    <p>
        C programming has three types of loops:
        <ol>
            <li>for loop</li>
            <li>while loop</li>
            <li>do...while loop</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        We will learn about for loop in this tutorial. In the next tutorial, 
        we will learn about while and do...while loop.
    </p>

    <h2>for Loop</h2>
    <p>The syntax of the for loop is:</p>

    <h5>
        for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement)<br>
        {<br>
            // statements inside the body of loop<br>
        }
    </h5>

    <h3>How for loop works?</h3>
    <li>The initialization statement is executed only once.</li>
    <li>Then, the test expression is evaluated. If the test expression 
        is evaluated to false, the for loop is terminated.</li>
    <li>However, if the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of the for 
        loop are executed, and the update expression is updated.</li>
    <li>Again the test expression is evaluated.</li>

    <p>This process goes on until the test expression is false. 
        When the test expression is false, the loop terminates.
    <br>

    <h3>Example 1: for loop</h3>
    <h5>
        <p>
            // Print numbers from 1 to 10<br>
            #include <stdio.h><br>

            int main() {<br>
                int i;<br>
                <br>
                for (i = 1; i < 11; ++i)<br>
            {<br>
                printf("%d ", i);<br>
            }<br>
                return 0;<br>
            }<br>
        </p>
    </h5>

    <h4>Output</h4>
    <h5>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</h5>

    <ol>
        <li>i is initialized to 1.</li>
        <li>The test expression i < 11 is evaluated. Since 1 less than 11 is true, the body of for loop is executed. 
            This will print the 1 (value of i) on the screen.</li>
        <li>The update statement ++i is executed.
            Now, the value of i will be 2. Again, the test expression is evaluated to true, and the body of for loop is executed. 
            This will print 2 (value of i) on the screen.</li>
        <li>Again, the update statement ++i is executed and the test expression i < 11 
            is evaluated. This process goes on until i becomes 11.</li>
        <li>When i becomes 11, i < 11 will be false, and the for loop terminates.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example 2: for loop</h3>
        <h5>
            <p>
                // Program to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers<br>
                // Positive integers 1,2,3...n are known as natural numbers<br>
                <br>
                #include <stdio.h><br>
                int main()<br>
                {<br>
                    int num, count, sum = 0;<br>
                    <br>
                    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");<br>
                    scanf("%d", &num);<br>
                    <br>
                    // for loop terminates when num is less than count<br>
                    for(count = 1; count <= num; ++count)<br>
                    {<br>
                        sum += count;<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    printf("Sum = %d", sum);<br>
                    <br>
                    return 0;<br>
                }<br>
        </p>
    </h5>

    <h4>Output</h4>
    <h5>Enter a positive integer: 10<br>
        Sum = 55
    </h5>

    <p>
        The value entered by the user is 
        stored in the variable num. Suppose, the user entered 10.

        <br>
        The count is initialized to 1 and the test expression is 
        evaluated. Since the test expression count<=num (1 less than or equal to 10) 
        is true, the body of for loop is executed and the 
        value of sum will equal to 1.

        <br>
        Then, the update statement ++count is executed and count
         will equal to 2. Again, the test expression is evaluated. 
         Since 2 is also less than 10, the test expression is evaluated 
         to true and the body of the for loop is executed. 
         Now, sum will equal 3.

         <br>
         This process goes on and the
         sum is calculated until the count reaches 11.

         <br>
         When the count is 11, the test expression is evaluated 
         to 0 (false), and the loop terminates.

         <br>Then, the value of sum is printed on the screen.
