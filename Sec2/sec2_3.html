    <h1>C while and do...while Loop</h1>
    <p><b>In this tutorial, you will learn to create while and do...while loop
        in C programming with the help of examples.</b>
    </p>
    <p>In programming, loops are used to repeat a 
    block of code until a specified condition is met. <br>
<br>
    C programming has three types of loops.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            for loop
        </li>
        <li>while loop</li>
        <li>do...while loop</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    In the previous tutorial, we learned about for loop. 
    In this tutorial, we will learn about while and do..while loop.
</p>

    <h2>while loop</h2>
    <p>The syntax of the while loop is:</p>
    <h5>
        while (testExpression) {<br>
            // the body of the loop <br>
          }
    </h5>

    <h3>How while loop works?</h3>
    <li>The while loop evaluates the testExpression inside the parentheses ().</li>
    <li>If testExpression is true, statements inside the body of while loop are executed. 
        Then, testExpression is evaluated again.</li>
    <li>The process goes on until testExpression is evaluated to false.</li>
    <li>If testExpression is false, the loop terminates (ends).</li>
    <p>To learn more about test expression (when the test expression is evaluated to true and false), 
    check out <a href="#">relational</a> and <a href="#">logical operators.</a></p>

    <h3>Flowchart of while loop</h3>

    <h3>Example 1: while loop</h3>
    <h5>
        <p>
            // Print numbers from 1 to 5<br>
            #include <stdio.h><br>

            int main() {<br>
                int i = 1;<br>
                <br>
                while (i <= 5) {<br>
                    printf("%d\n", i);<br>
                    ++i;<br>
            }<br>
            return 0;<br>
        }<br>
        </p>
    </h5>

    <h4>Output</h4>
    <h5>1 <br> 2 <br>3<br> 4<br> 5</h5>
    <p>
        Here, we have initialized i to 1.
        <ol>
            <li>When i = 1, the test expression i <= 5 is true. Hence, 
                the body of the while loop is executed. This prints 1 
                on the screen and the value of i is increased to 2.</li>
                <li>Now, i = 2, the test expression i <= 5 is again true. 
                    The body of the while loop is executed again. This prints 
                    2 on the screen and the value of i is increased to 3.</li>
                <li>This process goes on until i becomes 6. Then, the test 
                    expression i <= 5 will be false and the loop terminates.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>do...while loop</h3>
    <p>The do..while loop is similar to the while loop with one 
        important difference. The body of do...while loop is 
        executed at least once. 
        Only then, the test expression is evaluated.</p>

        <p>The syntax of the do...while loop is:</p>
        <h5>do {<br>
            // the body of the loop<br>
          }<br>
          while (testExpression);</h5>

          <h3>How do...while loop works?</h3>
          <li>The body of do...while loop is executed once. 
              Only then, the testExpression is evaluated.</li>
          <li>If testExpression is <b>true</b>, the body of the loop is executed 
              again and testExpression is evaluated once more.</li>
          <li>This process goes on until testExpression becomes <b>false.</b></li>
          <li>If testExpression is <b>false</b>, the loop ends.</li>

          <h3>Example 2: do...while loop</h3>
          <h5>
              <p>
                // Program to add numbers until the user enters zero<br>
                <br>
                #include <stdio.h><br>
                int main() {<br>
                  double number, sum = 0;<br>
                  <br>
                  // the body of the loop is executed at least once<br>
                  do {<br>
                    printf("Enter a number: ");<br>
                    scanf("%lf", &number);<br>
                    sum += number;<br>
                  }<br>
                  while(number != 0.0);<br>
                  <br>
                  printf("Sum = %.2lf",sum);<br>
                  <br>
                  return 0;<br>
                }<br>
              </p>
          </h5>
          <h4>Output</h4>
          <h5>
            Enter a number: 1.5<br>
            Enter a number: 2.4<br>
            Enter a number: -3.4<br>
            Enter a number: 4.2<br>
            Enter a number: 0<br>
            Sum = 4.70<br>
          </h5>

          <p>
            Here, we have used a do...while loop to prompt the user 
            to enter a number. The loop works as long as the 
            input number is not 0.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            The do...while loop executes at least once i.e. 
            the first iteration runs without checking the condition. 
            The condition is checked only after the first 
            iteration has been executed.
          </p>

          <h5>
            do {<br>
                printf("Enter a number: ");<br>
                scanf("%lf", &number);<br>
                sum += number;<br>
              }<br>
              while(number != 0.0);<br>
          </h5>

          <p>So, if the first input is a non-zero number,
              that number is added to the sum variable 
              and the loop continues to the next iteration. 
              This process is repeated until the user enters 0.
            </p>

            <p>
                But if the first input is 0, there will be no second iteration of the loop and sum becomes 0.0.
                <br>
                <br>Outside the loop, we print the value of sum.
