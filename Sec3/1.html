    <h1>C Functions</h1>
    <h3><b>In this tutorial, you will be introduced to functions (both user-defined and standard library functions) in C programming. Also, you will learn why functions are used in programming.</b></h3>

    <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
        <br>Suppose, you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:</p>
        <li>create a circle function</li>
        <li>create a color function</li>
        <p>Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.</p>


        <!-- Types of function -->

        <h2>Types of function</h2>
        <p>There are two types of function in C programming :</p>
        <li><a href="#">Standard library functions</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">User-defined functions</a></li>

        <!-- Standard library functions -->

        <h2>Standard library functions</h2>

        <p>The standard library functions are built-in functions in C programming.
        <br>These functions are defined in header files. For example,</p>
        <li>The printf() is a standard library function to send formatted output to the screen (display output on the screen). This function is defined in the stdio.h header file.
            <br>Hence, to use the printf()function, we need to include the stdio.h header file using #include <stdio.h>.</li>
        <br><li>The sqrt() function calculates the square root of a number. The function is defined in the math.h header file.</li>

        <!-- User-defined function -->

        <h2>User-defined function</h2>

        <p>You can also create functions as per your need. Such functions created by the user are known as user-defined functions.</p>

        <h2>How user-defined function works?</h2>
        <p>#include <stdio.h>
            void functionName()
            <br>{
                <br>... .. ...
                <br>... .. ...
                <br>}
            
            <br>int main()
            <br>{
                <br>... .. ...
                <br>... .. ...
            
                <br>functionName();
                
                <br>... .. ...
                <br>... .. ...
                <br>}</p>

            <br><p>The execution of a C program begins from the main() function.
                <br>When the compiler encounters functionName();, control of the program jumps to</p>
                <h4> void functionName()</h4>

                <p>And, the compiler starts executing the codes inside functionName().
                    <br><br>The control of the program jumps back to the main() function once code inside the function definition is executed.
                </p>

                <p>Note, function names are identifiers and should be unique.

                    <h2>Advantages of user-defined function</h2>
                        <ol><p>
                        <li>The program will be easier to understand, maintain and debug.</li>
                        <li>Reusable codes that can be used in other programs</li>
                        <li>A large program can be divided into smaller modules. Hence, a large project can be divided among many programmers.</li>
